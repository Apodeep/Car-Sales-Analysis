## Key Insights

1. **Sales increased by 23.6% in 2023**, while cars sold increased by 24.6%. Average selling price declined by less than 1%, indicating that growth was primarily volume-driven.

2. **Chevrolet recorded the highest total sales**, generating approximately $47.7M.

3. **Austin was the strongest region**, generating approximately $117.2M in sales.

4. **The $25K–$50K price segment generated the largest share of revenue**, contributing approximately 44% of total sales.

5. **Higher average selling price does not necessarily translate into higher total sales**, highlighting the difference between unit volume and price mix.

## Business Recommendations

- Prioritize commercial focus and availability for high-performing brands and models, subject to inventory validation.
- Give focused attention to the $25K–$50K price segment when planning product and marketing activities.
- Benchmark high-performing regions to identify practices that could potentially be replicated elsewhere.
- Continue monitoring unit growth alongside average selling price to ensure growth does not come with an undesirable change in price mix.
